### How to install Homebrew on Mac OS


<br>Paste that at a Terminal prompt:

```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ```
<br>
<br>

Install python (brew will install python2.7):

```brew install python```

```brew linkapps python```
<br>
<br>

Make sure using the Homebrew version of Python rather than the system version:

```which python```

/usr/local/bin/python
<br>
<br>
