### How to install Homebrew on Mac OS

Paste that at a Terminal prompt:

```/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"```

Install python (brew will install python2.7):

```brew install python```

```brew linkapps python```

Make sure using the Homebrew version of Python rather than the system version:

```which python```

/usr/local/bin/python
